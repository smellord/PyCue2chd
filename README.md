**_! WATCH OUT !_**
! this script will **delete** your .cue tracks files without asking !


very basic .py script to merge .cue trackfiles of psx roms into a single .chd file. (tested on windows)
The script checks for already converted .chds and begins where he stopped and deletes the track files after conversion.
