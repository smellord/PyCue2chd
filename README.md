**_! WATCH OUT !_**
! this script will **delete** your .cue tracks files without asking !


very basic .py script to merge .cue trackfiles of psx roms into a single .chd file. (tested on windows)
The script checks for already converted .chds and begins where he stopped and deletes the track files after conversion.

You'll need chdman in your paths
